# SpeedOfCars

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

## Demo
Check demo in -> https://miruthulaaa.github.io/Speed-of-cars/

## Problem statement
Create a website which shows the current speed of two cars (based on the layout on the
following pages).

Requirements:
1. If speed is > 100km/h please highlight it by making it red
2. You should use Angular, React or Vue.js
3. Keep it simple e.g. no server is needed
4. Everything should run in memory (just simulate the data on the frontend)
5. The final result should be executable as standalone program (no installation needed)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
